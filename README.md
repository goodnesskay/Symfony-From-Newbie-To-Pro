# Symfony-From-Newbie-To-Pro
> I created this repository to guide newbies to Symfony from the basics to professional level. This is because while learning Symfony I found out that there is really no structured way of getting to being a professioanal at Symfony after the getting started tutorial on the documantation.

## What To Expect In The Repository
- Resources (Videos and Blog posts)
- Sample Projects to work on while learning
- Links to project on some topics highlighted.
